'''
Given adjacency list access to a
directed acyclic graph, present an algorithm that finds the longest directed path in the graph.
A directed path is a sequence of distinct vertices u1, u2, . . . , ul such that for 1 ≤ i ≤ l − 1
there as an edge from ui to ui+1. (Hint: use the topological order).
