'''
Given adjacency list access to a directed
graph G, two vertices s and t, and an integer k â‰¥ 1, give an algorithm that finds a path
from s to t such that the number of edges in the path is divisible by k, or concludes that no
such path exists. Prove correctness and analyze the run time. The algorithm should run in
O(k(n + m)) time.
